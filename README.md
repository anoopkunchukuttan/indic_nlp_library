#Indic NLP Library

The goal of this project is to build Python based libraries for common text processing and Natural Language Processing in Indian languages. Indian languages share a lot of similarity in terms of script, phonology, language syntax, etc. and this library is an attempt to provide a general solution to very commonly required toolsets for Indian language text. 

The library provides the following functionalities: 

- Text Normalization
- Query Script Information
- Script Conversion
- Transliteration
- Tokenization
- Word Segmentation

The data resources required by the Indic NLP Library are hosted in a different repository. These resources are required for some modules. You can download from the [Indic NLP Resources](https://github.com/anoopkunchukuttan/indic_nlp_resources) project.
